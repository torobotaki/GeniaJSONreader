# Genia JSON reader

This little script is a utility to read the JSON files from the Genia dataset
for the BioNLP 2013 ST relation extraction task. 

This is my first ever use of python, and I will understand if you feel I write
non-python python code.

## Installation

see the source code and your OS/python doc

## Usage

Call the program with the directories containing the json files as parameters.

## Input/Output

Expected input is the json files from the GE task: https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst2013/tasks

Output is in the format of genia*txt files included in the repository
